		<h2 id="main-instructions">Instructions</h2>
		<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

		<h2 id="main-ways-play">Best Ways to Play</h2>
		<p>There are essentially countless ways you can play Concentration! Besides setting up your own "house rules" related to keeping score and/or turn order, the "best" ways you can play this game are based around two factors: who's playing, and what sort of cards you are using. Perhaps you want to go head-to-head against a friend and see who messes up first in trying to turn over pairs? Or maybe you have a large group of people playing and see who can create the most card pairs before all the cards are flipped? You can even use specially-made cards that use a wider variety of potential paired sets, or they can be based on a particular theme based on other popular series from television or video games. The possibilities are endless!!!</p>
